Re-designed program significantly.
Made it so less work is now done in the interrupt handler. For the most part it just updates state of the car/robot/tank.

Added a new feature to the car: a turret. The state variable now holds two numbers.
One for the motion of the tracks and another one for the motion of the turret.
Added another motor to rotate turret, and another motor to shoot the turret (as well as the keys to control them)

Added clock interrupts so that every second that the car spends stationary (track and turret off) one more led lights up until 7 are on (meaning the car can has aimed in its turret and can shoot). Any motion resets the leds to all off.

Added pulse modulation to the car, so the motors for the track and the motor for the turret are not always on.
