Researched how to get input from the keyboard as well as implemented the receiving of make codes from keys 'w' and 's' (for forward and reverse motion of the tracks). My original idea was to have the motors for the tracks be on as long as the key is pressed down and turn off when the key is released (a break code is received). However this implementation proved problematic, it seemed the key release would not be received or skipped over when the program was running in real time. Stepping over the instruction one by one while debugging the code however did register the key release. At the end of the lab it was decided to just go with another key press (space bar) acting as a key being released
