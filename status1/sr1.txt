Wrote the basic code for controlling the car/robot. For now the car/robot is controlled by the 3 push buttons (two for forward/backward motion and one for stopping). The buttons cause interrupts when they are pressed and set the motion of the two motors appropriately (depending on which button was pressed). At first I stored the current state of motion of the car/robot in the leds but  instead created a variable called state (0 for stationary, 1 for forward, 2 for reverse).
